# Boulder-Break
## ASCII level-based puzzle game
`C`

This early project tested my C and general programming fundamentals. It's been really helpful to have experience with a low-level language.  
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Pointers and addresses
- Functions
written in C using arrays, pointers and addresses.

*Download the boulderBreak.exe file if you'd like to try the game.*
